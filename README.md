## üöÄ Usage

### Running the Bot

```bash
python app.py

### Manual News Fetching

```python
from bot.scraper import ForexNewsScraper, ChatGPTAnalyzer
from bot.config import Config
from datetime import datetime

config = Config()
analyzer = ChatGPTAnalyzer(config.chatgpt_api_key)
scraper = ForexNewsScraper(config, analyzer)

# Fetch news for today (high impact)
news = await scraper.scrape_news(impact_level="high")

# Fetch news for specific date
target_date = datetime(2025, 7, 17)
news = await scraper.scrape_news(target_date, impact_level="high")

# Fetch all impact levels
news = await scraper.scrape_news(impact_level="all")
```

### Impact Levels

- `"high"`: Only high-impact (red) news events
- `"medium"`: High and medium-impact events
- `"low"`: Only low-impact (yellow) events
- `"all"`: All impact levels

## üîß Technical Details

### Enhanced Time Handling

The scraper now ensures all news items have proper times:

```python
# Before: Some items had "N/A" times
# After: All items have valid times with intelligent fallback
```

**Features:**
- Automatic time assignment for missing times
- Fallback to previous available time
- Default time (09:00) if no times available
- Robust time parsing for various formats

### Smart Sorting Algorithm

News is sorted by:
1. **Currency** (alphabetically)
2. **Time** (chronologically within each currency)

```python
# Sort key: (currency, time_minutes)
# Example: ("EUR", 540) for 09:00, ("USD", 630) for 10:30
```

### Anti-Bot Bypass Strategies

1. **Curl-based Scraping**:
   - Uses system curl with various header configurations
   - Simulates different browser types and mobile devices
   - Handles compressed responses and redirects

2. **HTTP Session Management**:
   - Establishes sessions with main site before accessing calendar
   - Manages cookies and maintains session state
   - Implements realistic delays between requests

3. **Playwright Stealth Mode**:
   - Removes WebDriver detection signatures
   - Masks automation indicators
   - Simulates human-like mouse movements and interactions
   - Handles Cloudflare Turnstile challenges automatically

4. **Undetected-Chromedriver**:
   - Human-like behavior simulation
   - Random delays and mouse movements
   - Advanced browser fingerprint masking
   - Automatic Cloudflare challenge handling

### Error Handling

- **Comprehensive timeout mechanisms**
- **Automatic fallback between strategies**
- **Detailed logging for debugging**
- **Graceful degradation when services are unavailable**
- **Exponential backoff for retry attempts**

### Message Formatting

The bot sends well-formatted messages with:
- **Currency grouping** with clear headers
- **Time-based sorting** within each currency
- **Comprehensive news details** (actual, forecast, previous)
- **AI analysis** (if ChatGPT API is configured)
- **Proper MarkdownV2 escaping** with fallback to HTML/plain text

## üìä Monitoring and Debugging

### Key Log Messages

| Message | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| `"Successfully loaded content"` | Page loaded successfully |
| `"Bot blocking detected"` | Anti-bot measures triggered |
| `"MarkdownV2 validation failed"` | Formatting issues detected |
| `"Successfully sent after fixing"` | Recovery successful |

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue: Still getting selector timeouts
**Solution**: The improved version tries multiple selectors and has longer timeouts. Check logs for which selectors are being attempted.

#### Issue: MarkdownV2 errors persist
**Solution**: The new version has comprehensive fallback to plain text. Check the `validate_markdown_v2` function output in logs.

#### Issue: Rate limiting or blocking
**Solution**: The improved version has randomized delays and better stealth. Consider increasing the base delay in `ForexNewsScraper.base_delay`.
