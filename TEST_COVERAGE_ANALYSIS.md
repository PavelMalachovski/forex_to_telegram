## 📋 **SPECIFIC TEST IMPROVEMENTS NEEDED**

### **1. Fix Factory Issues**
```python
# Current Issue: ValidationError for ForexNewsCreate
# Fix: Update factory to generate valid time strings
class ForexNewsCreateFactory(factory.Factory):
    class Meta:
        model = ForexNewsCreate

    time = factory.Faker('time', pattern='%H:%M')  # Generate string, not time object
    notification_minutes = factory.Iterator([15, 30, 60])  # Valid values only
```

### **2. Fix Async Client Issues**
```python
# Current Issue: 'async_generator' object has no attribute 'post'
# Fix: Proper async client configuration
@pytest.fixture
async def async_client():
    async with AsyncClient(app=app, base_url="http://test") as client:
        yield client
```

### **3. Add Missing Service Methods**
```python
# Add missing methods to services
class ForexService(BaseService):
    async def get_forex_news_by_id(self, db: AsyncSession, news_id: int):
        # Implementation needed

    async def count_forex_news(self, db: AsyncSession) -> int:
        # Implementation needed
```
